   ```bash
   poetry shell
    ```
2. **Environment Variables:**
    1. Ensure sample_env is moved to .env in your project root.
    2. Customize the variables in the .env file according to your specific needs.

    ```
    mv sample_env .env
    ```
    Update the variables in the .env file with the required values.





3. **Evoke the incantation - Run the application:**

    ðŸš€ Cast the spell to awaken the main script using Python. You can either unleash it directly:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
    ðŸŒŒ Or channel the energy using nohup to let it dance in the mystical background:
    ```
    nohup python main.py &
